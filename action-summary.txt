Any prefix can be added for branch only importanted thing is to add key. 
The key is ticket (for this ticket) SNODE-6.
and commit should start with this key. But dont know is there any problem while adding prefix during commit

So stages to test : 
Does commit  with prefix work?
Is Character must be same?
